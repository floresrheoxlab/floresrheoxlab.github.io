# Flores RheoX Lab

Rheology Across Scales
Computational and Experimental Soft Matter Rheology

We are a research group working on rheology and multiscale simulations for soft matter, with a focus on surfactants and hydrogels. Our goal is to connect molecular structure and microstructure to macroscopic flow behaviour of complex fluids and material performance.

**Keywords:** rheology · complex fluids · surfactants · hydrogels · multiscale modelling

## Research

We combine experiments, modelling, and simulation to understand and predict the mechanics of soft materials.
