Computational and Experimental Soft Matter Rheology at The University of Manchester

We are a research group working on rheology and multiscale simulations for soft matter, with a focus on surfactants and hydrogels. Our goal is to connect molecular structure and microstructure to macroscopic flow behaviour of complex fluids and material performance.

**Keywords:** rheology · complex fluids · surfactants · hydrogels · multiscale modelling

---

## Research

We combine experiments, modelling, and simulation to understand and predict the flow behaviour of soft materials.
