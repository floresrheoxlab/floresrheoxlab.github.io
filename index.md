*Computational and Experimental Soft Matter Rheology at The University of Manchester*

Rheology across scales. We are a research group working on rheology and multiscale simulations for soft matter, with a focus on surfactants and hydrogels. Our goal is to connect molecular structure and microstructure to macroscopic flow behaviour of complex fluids and material performance.

# PhD Opportunities

We combine experiments, modelling, and simulation to understand and predict the flow behaviour of soft materials. We are currently recruiting PhD students for the following projects:

(Fully funded)  
*Hybrid modelling for surfactant formulations* [More details and apply here!](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/hybrid-modelling-for-sustainable-formulation-design-and-innovation/?p183119)  

*Small molecule partitioning in surfactant micelles* [More details and apply here!](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/small-molecule-partitioning-in-surfactant-micelles/?p193669)  

*Optimization of Multiscale Predictive Models for Surfactant Self-Assembly* [More details and apply here!](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/optimization-of-multiscale-predictive-models-for-surfactant-self-assembly/?p193650)  

(Self-funded)  
*Rheology of peptide-based self-assembled hydrogels* [More details and apply here!](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/rheological-studies-of-self-assembled-peptide-based-hydrogels-towards-injectable-biocompatible-hydrogels-for-cells-and-drugs-in-vivo-delivery/?p186170)  

We are always happy to hear from prospective students and collaborators.
