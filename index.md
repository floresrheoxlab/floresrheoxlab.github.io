# Flores RheoX Lab

We are a research group working on rheology and soft matter, with a focus on surfactants, hydrogels, and multiscale simulation. Our goal is to connect molecular structure and microstructure to macroscopic flow behaviour and material performance.

**Keywords:** nonlinear rheology · complex fluids · surfactants · hydrogels · multiscale modelling

---

## Research

We combine experiments, modelling, and simulation to understand and predict the mechanics of soft materials.

## People

We are always happy to hear from prospective students and collaborators.
