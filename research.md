Our work focuses on the mechanics and flow of complex fluids and soft solids, combining rheological measurements with modelling and molecular simulation.

*Rheology*    
Yielding, viscoelasticity, thixotropy, and time-dependent flow in complex fluids and soft solids.

*Surfactants and self-assembly*    
Microstructure–rheology relationships in surfactant systems, mixtures, and formulations.

*Hydrogels and soft networks*    
Structure–property links and nonlinear mechanics in physical and mixed networks.

*Multiscale simulation*    
Simulation workflows (atomistic → coarse-grained → continuum) to bridge mesoscale structure and macroscopic rheology.
