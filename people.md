*Steph is a Unilever - Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Fellow in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Manchester. Her research lies at the interface of soft matter physics, materials science, and chemical engineering, with a focus on the structure-property relationships of complex fluids and soft materials. Steph works with hydrogels, surfactants, and other self-assembled systems, combining rheology, coarse-grained and atomistic simulation, and emerging machine learning approaches. She graduated in Applied Physics at the University of San Carlos, Philippines and obtained a PhD at the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology. This was followed by a stint as a postdoctoral research associate at The Centre in Advanced Fluid Engineering for Digital Manufacturing (CAFE4DM). Her work bridges fundamental soft matter physics with real-world applications in personal care, biomedical technologies, and sustainability.*
